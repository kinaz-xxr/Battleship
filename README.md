# Battleship
A Battleship Game.\
This is a game I made with Java and JavaFX library in highschool.\
The game is a single-player game where you will be playing against the computer.\
Like an orginal Battleship game, you will place your ships on a 5x5 board. Then you will try to hit the computer's ships by selecting the square. The CPU's moves are enhanced instead of being random so watch out! Hope you have fun :)
